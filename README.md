# Joystick Enclosures

The printable STLs are found here. 

I do not provide source code for the models, as I sell these as products. Need to pay the rent!


PALM requires:
 Arduino Pro Micro
 PlayStation2 Style Analog Stick
 (4) M2.5x4 screws to hold joystick to enclosure
 (4) M2.5x5 screws to close case.
 
 Print flat surfaces down! You may need to rotate the TOP 180 in your slicer.

 Use Super Glue to close the case (I'm looking at using screws instead).
