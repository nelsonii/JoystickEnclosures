To complete this project you will need:

* 3D printed parts (the STLs) -- there are three
* 3.7" Resistive Touch Screen (Adafruit 333)
* Touch Controller TSC2007 (Adafruit 5423)
* QT Py SAMD21 or similar (with STEMMA/Quiic -- optional)
* JST SH 4 pin 50 MM STEMMA/Quiic (if avoiding soldering)
* (8) M2-4 screws (controller mount, sensor support mount)
* (4) M2-12 screws (enclosure)

Note on printing:

SensorSupport includes a thin (0.2) first layer on purpose -- this makes it easier/faster to print. Simply snip out the cutout with side cutters or similar. You don't need to punch the screw holes, they will clear as you fasten the screws.
